## 📘 Overview

**Password Strength Checker** is a beginner-friendly **Python project** that evaluates the strength of a password using multiple security parameters — such as length, uppercase and lowercase characters, numbers, and special symbols.  

It helps users understand how password validation works while teaching **core Python programming concepts** such as conditional statements, string manipulation, loops, and input validation.  
This project is designed as an early coding exercise for students and beginners looking to build confidence with Python and GitHub workflows.
