🔐 Password Strength Checker

A Python-based password analysis tool that evaluates the strength of user passwords using rule-based logic and security best practices. Designed for cybersecurity-conscious developers, IT teams, and organizations aiming to enhance user credential hygiene.

🚀 Overview

This project assesses password strength by analyzing:

Length and complexity

Character variety (upper, lower, digits, symbols)

Dictionary word detection

Repetitive and sequential patterns

Entropy estimation

Blacklist comparison (common or breached passwords)

It provides quantitative scores and actionable feedback to help users create robust passwords compliant with modern security frameworks (e.g., NIST SP 800-63B).

🧩 Features

✅ Real-time strength evaluation

✅ Configurable scoring logic

✅ Dictionary-based weak password detection

✅ Entropy calculation for advanced users

✅ Clean CLI and extensible architecture

✅ Optional integration hooks for corporate systems

🏗️ Tech Stack

Language: Python 3.x

Core Libraries: re, string, math, collections

Optional Dependencies: requests (for live blacklist lookups)

⚙️ How It Works

User inputs a password.

The script validates it against multiple security rules.

A composite score and strength category (Weak → Very Strong) are calculated.

The program outputs a strength rating and tailored improvement suggestions.

📈 Example Output
Password: P@ssw0rd123!
Strength Score: 82 / 100
Rating: Strong
Feedback: Add more unique characters and avoid common patterns.

🔧 Future Enhancements
